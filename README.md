Hi! I'm Natalyn. I enjoy coding in many languages, including Python, Java, JS, and HTML. I do lots of coding projects for many things, 
from my school's robotics team to just my own fun. Most of my activity here will either be for robotics or for a passion project for my school's
Extended Learning Program.
